# Zen Cart - Find Extra Spaces
Tool to find spaces in files before the initial php tag, at the end of the file and UTF-8 BOM.

The tool can also fix these problems, but as always,
- DO NOT TRUST ANY THIRD-PARTY CODE, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
- TEST IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER, and then copy the edited files to your  production site.

## Use
Copy the single file to the root of your shop and manually (in the browser address bar) execute: 

YOUR_SHOP/find_extra_spaces.php

## Changelog
2023 March torvista: resurrected. HTML validated, some IDE recommendations, made EOF substitution not default, no functional changes.

2005 Originally developed by Andrew Berezin, one of the great Zen Cart contributors, now sadly not with us:
