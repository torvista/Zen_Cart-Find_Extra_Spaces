# Zen Cart - Find Extra Spaces
Tool to find spaces in files before the initial php tag, at the end of the file and UTF-8 BOM.

The tool can also fix these problems, but as always,
- DO NOT TRUST ANY THIRD-PARTY CODE, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
- TEST IN YOUR DEVELOPMENT SERVER, and then copy the edited files to your  production site.

## Compatibility
Not dependent on the Zen Cart version. Code compatible with php7.4+.

## Use
Copy the single file to the root of your shop and manually (in the browser address bar) execute: 

YOUR_SHOP/find_extra_spaces.php
